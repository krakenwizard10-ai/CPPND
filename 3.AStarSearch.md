### Passed by Reference in C++:

Passed by Value:

```c++
int MultiplyByTwo(int i) {
    i = 2*i;
    return i;
}
```

Passed by Reference:

```c++
int MultiplyByTwo(int &i) {
    i = 2*i;
    return i;
}
```



### Constants

`const`: The variable can only be evaluated at run time, but I promise not to change it after it is initialized.

`constexpr`: The variable can be evaluated at compile time, and I promise not to change it after it is initialized.
