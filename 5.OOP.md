# Lesson 5 OOP

### 1. Structures

Structures allow developers to create their own types ("user-defined" types) to aggregate data relevant to their needs.

**Member Initialization**

In order to ensure that objects of our `Date` structure always start in a valid state, we can initialize the members from within the structure definition.

```c++
struct Date {
  int day{1};
  int month{1};
  int year{0};
};
```

**Access Specifiers**

Members of a structure can be specified as `public` or `private`.

By default, all members of a structure are public, unless they are specifically marked `private`.

**Accessors And Mutators**

To access private members, we typically define public "accessor" and "mutator" member functions (sometimes called "getter" and "setter" functions).

```c++
struct Date {
 public:
  int Day() { return day; }
  void Day(int day) { this.day = day; }
  int Month() { return month; }
  void Month(int month) { this.month = month; }
  int Year() { return year; }
  void Year(int year) { this.year = year; }

 private:
  int day{1};
  int month{1};
  int year{0};
};
```

**Avoid Trivial Getters And Setters**

Sometimes accessors are not necessary, or even advisable. The [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rh-get) recommend, "A trivial getter or setter adds no semantic value; the data item could just as well be public."

- This `class` could be made into a `struct`, with no logic or "invariants", just passive data. The member variables could both be public, with no accessor functions:

```
struct Point {   // Good: concise
    int x {0};   // public member variable with a default initializer of 0
    int y {0};   // public member variable with a default initializer of 0
};
```

### 2. Classes

By convention, programmers use structures when member variables are independent of each other, and [use classes when member variables are related by an "invariant"](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c2-use-class-if-the-class-has-an-invariant-use-struct-if-the-data-members-can-vary-independently).

- `Class`: 
  - Members are private by default.
  - Use it when you want to add in an "invariant", a rule that limits the values of member variables.
- `Struct`: Members are public by default.

### 3. Constructor

An operation that initializes (“constructs”) an object. Typically a constructor establishes an invariant and often acquires resources needed for an object to be used (which are then typically released by a destructor).

[The compiler will define a default constructor](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/default_constructor), which accepts no arguments, for any class or structure that does not contain an explicitly-defined constructor.

### 4. Scope Resolution

`::` is the [scope resolution operator](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzarg/cplr175.htm). We can use this operator to specify which namespace or class to search in order to resolve an identifier.

```
Person::move(); \\ Call the move the function that is a member of the Person class.
std::map m; \\ Initialize the map container from the C++ Standard Library.  
```

**Namespaces**

[Namespaces](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/namespace) allow programmers to group logically related variables and functions together. Namespaces also help to avoid conflicts between to variables that have the same name in different parts of a program.

```c++
namespace English {
void Hello() { std::cout << "Hello, World!\n"; }
}  // namespace English

namespace Spanish {
void Hello() { std::cout << "Hola, Mundo!\n"; }
}  // namespace Spanish

int main() {
  English::Hello();
  Spanish::Hello();
}
```



### 5. Initializer Lists

[Initializer lists](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initializer_list) initialize member variables to specific values, just before the class constructor runs. 

```cpp
Date::Date(int day, int month, int year) : year_(y) { // initialize list
  Day(day); // allows us to apply the invariants set in the mutator
  Month(month); // allows us to apply the invariants set in the mutator
}
```

**Advantages of initializer lists**

1. Initializer lists exist for a number of reasons. First, the compiler can optimize initialization faster from an initialization list than from within the constructor.
2. A second reason is a bit of a technical paradox. If you have a `const` class attribute, you can only initialize it using an initialization list. Otherwise, you would violate the `const` keyword simply by initializing the member in the constructor!
3. The third reason is that attributes defined as [references](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-glossary) must use initialization lists.

**Initializing Constant Members** (Must use initializer lists)

```c++
struct Person {
public:
  Person(std::string const& name) : name(name) {}
  std::string const name;
};

// Test
int main() {
  Person alice("Alice");
  Person bob("Bob");
  assert(alice.name != bob.name);
}
```



### 6. Encapsulation

[Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) is the grouping together of data and logic into a single unit.

```c++
#include <string>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

class Car {
    // TODO: Declare private attributes
    private:
        int horse_power;
        int weight;
        char *brand;
        
    // TODO: Declare getter and setter for brand
    public:
        void SetBrand(std::string name);
        std::string GetBrand() const;
        
};

// Define setters
void Car::SetBrand(std::string name) {
    // Initialization of char array
    Car::brand = new char[name.length() + 1];
    // copying every character from string to char array;
    strcpy(Car::brand, name.c_str());
}

// Define getters
std::string Car::GetBrand() const {
    return Car::brand;
}

// Test in main()
int main() 
{
    Car car;
    car.SetBrand("Peugeot");
    std::cout << car.GetBrand() << "\n";   
}
```

**Static Members**

Class members can be declared `static`, which means that the member belongs to the entire class, instead of to a specific instance of the class. More specifically, a `static` member is created only once and then shared by all instances (i.e. objects) of the class. That means that if the `static` member gets changed, either by a user of the class or within a member function of the class itself, then all members of the class will see that change the next time they access the `static` member.

`static` members are **declared** within their `class` (often in a header file) but in most cases they must be **defined** within the global scope. That's because memory is allocated for `static` variables immediately when the program begins, at the same time any global variables are initialized.

```c++
#include <cassert>

class Foo {
 public:
  static int count;
  Foo() { Foo::count += 1; }
};

int Foo::count{0};

int main() {
  Foo f{};
  assert(Foo::count == 1);
}
```

An exception to the global definition of `static` members is if such members can be marked as [`constexpr`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constexpr). In that case, the `static` member variable can be both declared and defined within the `class` definition:

```c++
struct Kilometer {
  static constexpr int meters{1000};
};
```
